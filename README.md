# android-test-fragments-bottombar
Android test bottom navigation with fragments (tabs add/hide, not replace)


# Details

This is the simple test of Android App where I test bottom navigator with tabs (fragments). These tabs
are added/hided/shown instead of replace to save their state in memory.

Also TabFragment has recyclerview of items. When you select an item, opens new fragment which 
replaces whole fragment container for all tabs
